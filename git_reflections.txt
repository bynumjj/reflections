1.  How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Identifying the lines of code that had been changed allowed me to search for the bug more efficiently, as I did not have to review the entire file.



2.  How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It allows you to save versions that have working code you might have corrupted through editing in subsequent drafts. And it allows you to compare the features and functionality of different versions.  And it makes it easier to identify errors.



3.  What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?


4. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?


5.  How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?



6.  How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?



7.  Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
